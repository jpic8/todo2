# todo2

This is a rough draft attempt for the Todo List project for the Odin Project.

I really got lost in the weeds on my first attempt trying to incorporate Webpack for this project. Using Javascript to create the DOM elements was fine, but I was running into issues as to how to split up my Javascript into individual modules and call them in the correct order.

In it's current form this is essentially just the Library project refactored as a To Do list.
